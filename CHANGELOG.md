- Seasonal median support in distribution classes
- ECDF (empirical cumulative distribution function) exposed in core API
- Heat index calculations in meteox2y module
- Brunner compound index module with Cython optimization
- Automatic timezone offset calculation from latitude/longitude
- `to_df()` method with optional unit conversions from config
- Docker support for simulation deployment
- Tox integration for testing against installed wheels
- Python 3.14 wheel support
- Improved VG object serialization and `__str__` representation

### Changed
- Extracted dwd_opendata as separate package (github.com/iskur/dwd_opendata)
- Migrated test suite from nosetests to pytest
- Enhanced time parsing logic
- Improved KDE with performance caching

## [1.3.0]

### Added
- Missing value infilling using VAR processes prior to simulation
